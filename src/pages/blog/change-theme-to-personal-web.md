title: Change website theme to Personal Web
summary: Time for a new website theme.

This website was not correctly showing all content.  The previous Hugo theme being used, did not support including content in list pages. It also had not been updated in a long time.

So, I decided to migrate to a new Hugo theme: [Personal Web](https://themes.gohugo.io/themes/personal-web/). 

This theme seems actively maintained and was reasonably close to the look and feel of the previous theme.  With a bit of tweaks, I got it working the way I want.
