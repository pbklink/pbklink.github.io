What is the opposite (antonym) of the word "Monopoly"?

You are probably looking for a word that means **competitive market**. In fact, people have suggested that you actually use these 2 words as an antonym for monopoly[^1]. Clear and easily understood.

However if you really want a single word antonym, you could consider using **Polypoly** (or the alternative spelling **Polyopoly**). It means: "The presence of a large number of relatively small buyers and sellers, none of whom can influence the price of commodities[^2]". This sounds like "competitive market" however this word is no longer in [common usage](https://books.google.com/ngrams/graph?content=monopoly%2Cpolypoly&year_start=1900&year_end=2000&corpus=15&smoothing=3&share=), so use with care.

If monopoly is where one _seller_ dominates a market, what do you call a market dominated by one _buyer_? There is a word for that: **Monopsony**[^3]. An example would be the Department of Defence for local suppliers. It is an opposite but maybe not an antonym. However it may be the opposite you are looking for.
