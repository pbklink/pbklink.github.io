My keyboard has been updated with the [HUI firmware update](https://support.novationmusic.com/hc/en-gb/articles/360009516479-What-does-the-HUI-update-for-the-Impulse-do-) so I do not have to use Novation Automap.  There is [an article](https://support.novationmusic.com/hc/en-gb/articles/360014213299-How-to-setup-Studio-One-with-the-Impulse-HUI-firmware-update) on the Novation website describing how to connect an Impulse keyboard to Studio One, however it only covers the HUI connection (that allows using the knobs and controls on the keyboard to control Studio one).  The article does not cover connecting getting midi input into tracks.

## USB Driver

Make sure the USB driver for the Novation Impulse keyboard is installed.  This can be downloaded from: [https://downloads.novationmusic.com/novation/impulse/](https://downloads.novationmusic.com/novation/impulse/)

## Devices

You need to add 2 external devices to Studio One to connect an Impulse keyboard (Studio One | Options | External Devices | Add...).
1. Mackie | HUI device\
This is covered in the above Novation [article](https://support.novationmusic.com/hc/en-gb/articles/360014213299-How-to-setup-Studio-One-with-the-Impulse-HUI-firmware-update).  Note that the settings for Windows differ from those in the screenshots.
2. A generic new keyboard for the Novation Keyboard\
Select `New Keyboard` from top of Add Device list and enter Manufacturer `Novation` and set the Device Name to the keyboard model - eg `Impulse61`.

The list of external devices should look something like:

# HUI Device

Use the Edit... button to update the properties of the HUI device.  You only need to change:
1. the `Receive from` to `Impulse HUI` or in windows, to `Midi In 3` (may be slightly different)
1. the `Send to` to `Impulse HUI` or in windows, to `Midi Out 2` (may be slightly different)

The properties window should look something like:
<Image src={huiExternalDeviceImage} alt="HUI Device" />

# Impulse Keyboard Device

Use the Edit... button to update the properties of the Novation Impulse device.  You only need to change:
1. the `Receive from` to `Impulse` (may be slightly different)
1. leave `Send to` set to none.

The properties window should look something like:
