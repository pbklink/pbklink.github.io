summary: "I use a Novation Impulse 61 keyboard with PreSonus Studio one.  Every now and then, I need to fix up the connectivity between my keyboard and Studio One.  This blog post is to remind me of how it is done."

I used to enjoy mountain biking. Taking my bike to visiting Mount Buller in summer and riding the gentler (blue) trails was a lot of fun.  However just before Covid, I fell and broker a finger (not at Buller though).  My recovery time flowed into the ['ring of steel lockdown'](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2020-11-08/how-melbournes-coronavirus-travel-rules-are-expected-to-change/12858310) so I was unable to ride my mountain bike for quite a while.

When the Covid lockdown finally lifted, I found I had lost my desire for Mountain Bike riding.  While my deteriorating knees were an issue, I think it was more that my personal risk profile had changed.  The idea of a long recovery from an accident now weighed heavily on my mind.

But I miss the concentration and making quick judgement calls!

So when I now visit Buller, I jog the trails instead.  Making sure your foot placement is correct makes the mind work hard.  The scenery is an added bonus.
