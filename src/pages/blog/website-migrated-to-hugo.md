This website has now been migrated to the Hugo website framework. This move was done for several reasons:

* The previous website creation software was no longer being actively developed
* It also did not support responsive design. You had to create 2 separate pages for desktop and mobile.
* It had limited support for blogs.

The move was triggered by my desire to be more active in publishing information on my website. Since the previous package was no longer being developed, I investigated alternatives. I liked the idea of a static web site generator and Hugo seemed to best meet my needs.

I previously have worked on another static web site generator called [MkDocs](http://www.mkdocs.org/). I already had a reasonably understanding of how static web site generators worked and thought it would be reasonably easy to learn Hugo. It was not. There is a lot to Hugo. The [Hugo website](https://gohugo.io/) provided quite a lot of information however it took a lot of time playing and experimenting with Hugo before it started to sink in.

I now know enough to get my website out in a reasonable state and to be able to post to it. I would really like to understand Hugo better but cannot become fixated on it. Lots of other things to do.
