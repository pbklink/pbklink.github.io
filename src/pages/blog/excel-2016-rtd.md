summary: Getting Excel 2016 64 bit to communicate with a 32 bit automation RTD server.

Excel 2016 64 bit will not communicate with a 32 bit automation RTD server. This caused me a fair bit of grief in trying to get my new out-of-process RTD server to work. Many thanks to [Add-in Express](https://www.add-in-express.com) for their assistance with this problem.
