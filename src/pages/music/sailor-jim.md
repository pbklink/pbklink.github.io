### Written 2004/2005 

Well actually it was first written in around 1987. However it never got much further than a melody line and some lyrics. During 2004, I finally got around to producing and finished the production in 2005. 

This was my first serious effort at producing a song.  I learnt a lot - especially that it takes a lot of work.  Hopefully the next one does not take this long.

### Lyrics

```
Sailor Jim, look to the wind. 
See the clouds, they're blowing in. 
Drop your anchor in safe shelter, 
let the storm go by. 
 
Observe the signs, the gentle breeze, 
the choppy waves and the dark gray seas. 
Before night falls you'll see the squalls 
but then it will be too late. 
 
I know you want to sail and go, 
to see the one you love and know, 
though love is great, it cannot conquer time. 
 
But never you fear, 
she'll be waiting there. 
Tears in her eyes, 
as your ship docks at the pier, 
she'll say she loves you and she needs you as she runs into your arms. 
 
As the storm goes raging by, 
ferocious winds and waves so high. 
But leeward side of an island break, 
his ship should ride it out 
 
And down below, a sleepless night, 
his thoughts they turn to kids and wife. 
A home so warm and full of care. 
A tender kiss, a bed to share. 
 
I know you want to sail and go, 
to see the one you love and know, 
though love is great, it cannot conquer time. 
 
But never you fear, 
she'll be waiting there. 
Tears in her eyes, 
as your ship docks at the pier 
she'll say she loves you and she needs you as she runs into your arms. 
 
There's a true love that's here waiting, and it waits so longingly,  
for a husband, cross the water, far away. 
Let the storms show you mercy, let the stars guide you home,  
and I'll wait for you while always you roam. 
 
And when my fears come and chase me with death and despair,  
I turn to God, and find hope in his care. 
 
Let my faith make you stronger, let my thoughts draw you near. 
Let our love vanquish all that you fear. 
There's a family that needs you, and with children who care,  
ask the Lord to protect you with each single prayer. 
 
As I stand on this pier, I just know in my heart, 
that the seas they won't keep us apart. 
```
