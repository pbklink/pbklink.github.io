What are the songs and music that makes your mind and body tingle? The songs that when they start on the car radio, make you smile and enjoy the drive. The songs that divert your attention at cafes, supermarkets and parties. The songs you sometimes desperately search for by hunting through the stations on the car radio when none of the stations are being helpful.

For me, this list of songs is limited. Probably somewhere between 500 to 1000. But what are they? The list stretches back my early primary school days.

Several years ago, I started to develop a play list that lists them all. It is an ongoing project. Sometimes I will hear a long forgotten favourite that needs to be on the list. So I make a mental note to include it as soon as I get the chance. However, a bigger thrill is to hear a new song that sends tingles through me and is worthy of my list. Unfortunately, nowadays, this is a rare event but wonderful when it happens.

Here is my list as of October 2024. (Extracted with [chosic](https://www.chosic.com/spotify-playlist-analyzer/))
