## Lyrics

```text
Theres a world,
a world that's out there wai-ting
op-por-tun-i-ty there for the tak-ing,
there for peo-ple like you and me.
All you need,
is a bit of im-ma-gi-na-tion,
some drive some de-ter-min-a-tion,
and the will, to chase, a dream.

So I looked,
I looked real har-d at my life,
I'm not go-in to work to from work nine to five,
for rest of all my fu-ture days.
And I took,
I took a dre-am from my mind,
took a new tack a-long a diff-rent line,
and now I've found my way.

Got-ta fol-low your dreams,
got-ta fol-low your dreams,
You got-ta fight for them,
and strive for them,
got-ta keep them a-live.
Dreams, don't you e-ver lose your dreams,
Cos they will send you high,
Pick up your wings and fly.

Dreams, they'll put you in a pic-ture show,
Might hear your-self on the ra-di-o,
Place you in some far out scenes.
You can find,
find your-self with a bus-ness knack,
in a car or a bike on a ra-cing track,
in a yacht on some dis-tant seas.

Got-ta fol-low your dreams,
Got-ta fol-low your dreams,
You got-ta fight for them, and strive for them,
Got-ta keep them a-live,
Dreams, don't you e-ver lose your dreams,
cos they will send you high,
Pick up your wings and fly.

Don't try to hold me down, cos I'-ll break free,
Don't try to tell me I'm wrong I know that I'-ll suc-ceed,
Don't need no bad vibes, and I don't need no hick jives.
Let me fol-low my dreams,
let me fol-low my dre-eams,
let me fol-low my dre-e-eams.

And I find,
find my-self li-ving har-der,
find my-self li-ving fas-ter,
li-ving on a high of vi-tal-i-ty.
And it seems,
seems, I'm so much stron-ger,
I can keep at it so much lon-ger,
This is how life should be.
```
